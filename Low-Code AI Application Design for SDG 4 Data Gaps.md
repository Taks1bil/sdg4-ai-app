# Low-Code AI Application Design for SDG 4 Data Gaps

Based on the provided workflow, this conceptual low-code AI application aims to demonstrate the process of closing data gaps in SDG 4 (Quality Education). The application will be designed with a user-friendly interface, allowing non-technical users to interact with the AI workflow.

## Application Components and Workflow:

### 1. Data Ingestion Module
*   **Purpose:** To allow users to bring in various data sources for analysis.
*   **Features:**
    *   **File Upload:** Option to upload CSV or Excel files containing educational data (e.g., enrollment rates, literacy rates, completion rates).
    *   **Simulated Database Connection:** A placeholder for connecting to UN or World Bank databases. For a low-code implementation, this might involve pre-loaded sample data or a simplified API call simulation.
    *   **Data Preview:** Display the first few rows of the ingested data for user verification.

### 2. Data Preprocessing Module
*   **Purpose:** To clean, transform, and prepare the ingested data for machine learning.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Missing Value Handling:** Options to impute missing values (e.g., mean, median, mode) or remove rows/columns with missing data.
    *   **Data Normalization/Scaling:** Simple options for normalizing numerical data (e.g., Min-Max scaling, Standardization).
    *   **Feature Selection (Basic):** Allow users to select relevant columns for the model.
    *   **Data Summary:** Display basic statistics (mean, median, count) and data types of the processed dataset.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Module
*   **Purpose:** To train and apply a machine learning model to address data gaps.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Model Selection:** A dropdown to choose from a few pre-defined low-code friendly models (e.g., Linear Regression for prediction, Logistic Regression/Decision Tree for classification).
    *   **Target Variable Selection:** Allow users to select the column they want to predict or classify (e.g., 'completion_rate', 'out_of_school_status').
    *   **Training Initiation:** A button to trigger model training.
    *   **Model Performance Metrics:** Display basic metrics like R-squared (for regression) or Accuracy/Precision/Recall (for classification) on a validation set.

### 4. Prediction & Visualization Module
*   **Purpose:** To generate predictions and visualize the results to highlight insights.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Prediction Generation:** Automatically apply the trained model to new or existing data to fill gaps or make forecasts.
    *   **Interactive Visualizations:**
        *   **Bar Charts/Line Graphs:** To show trends or comparisons (e.g., predicted vs. actual completion rates).
        *   **Geospatial Map (Conceptual):** If location data is available, a simple choropleth map to visualize predicted values across regions (e.g., predicted out-of-school rates by district). This might require a simplified approach in a low-code context, perhaps using pre-defined regional boundaries.
        *   **Data Table:** Display the original data alongside the newly predicted or imputed values.

### 5. Validation & Iteration Module
*   **Purpose:** To allow for continuous improvement and feedback incorporation.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Feedback Mechanism:** A simple text input field for users to provide feedback on the predictions or visualizations.
    *   **Retrain Option:** A button to retrain the model with updated parameters or new data (simulating the iterative process).
    *   **Download Results:** Option to download the processed data with predictions.

## Technology Stack (Conceptual for Low-Code):

*   **Frontend/Backend:** Streamlit (Python-based, handles both UI and logic).
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas (for data manipulation).
*   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (for basic ML models).
*   **Visualization:** Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly (integrated with Streamlit).

This design emphasizes simplicity and user interaction, making it suitable for a low-code environment and aligning with the goal of demonstrating the AI workflow for non-technical users.
